            Born from a love of code and a passion for culinary creativity, Snack Overflow is the brainchild of two software engineers turned food enthusiasts. After countless late-night coding sessions fueled by instant noodles, energy drinks, and the occasional pizza, they realized that the tech world needed a better dining experience. But this wouldn’t just be any restaurant—it would be the perfect fusion of their two great loves: food and technology.
            <br /><br />
            In 2023, Snack Overflow opened its doors to hungry coders, tech lovers, and foodies alike. The name, a playful nod to the infamous "stack overflow" error, reflects our belief that good food, like good code, should be innovative, satisfying, and occasionally a little cheeky. Our mission is to provide a space where people can "debug" their hunger while enjoying inventive, high-quality dishes in a laid-back yet high-tech environment.
            <br /><br />
            At Snack Overflow, the menu is just as quirky and exciting as the name suggests. From our "404: Fries Not Found" to the crowd-favorite "Byte-sized Bites," every dish is designed with a dash of creativity and a whole lot of flavor. We’re committed to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients, ensuring that every meal is as thoughtful as a well-written line of code.
            <br /> <br />
            The restaurant’s ambiance mirrors the fusion of tech and food, with cozy, modern decor and subtle geeky touches like menu screens, USB charging stations at every table, and even QR codes that let you customize your meal. Whether you’re here to fuel up before your next big coding project or just to enjoy a fun night out, Snack Overflow is your go-to spot for delicious food with a tech twist!
